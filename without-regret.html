            <p>For as long as I could remember, I always loved drawing. But there was a certain time in elementary school that created the artist that I am today.</p>
            <p>Around second and third grade of elementary school, I decided to search the internet for drawing tips and tutorials. With the help of of these step by step processes at a young age, I tought myself how to make realistic drawings on my own throughout the years.</p>
            <p>In middle school, high school, and my beginning years of college, I learned more art tips that helped improve my skills.</p>
